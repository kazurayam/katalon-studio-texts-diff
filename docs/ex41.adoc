== ex41 pretty print JSON

A JSON text can be formatted in two ways --- Compact form and Pretty-printed form.

Compact JSON example:
[source,json]
----
{ "abbreviation" : "JST", "client_ip" : "163.131.26.17", "datetime" : "2023-10-01T22:15:18.742317+09:00", "day_of_week" : 0, "day_of_year" : 274, "dst" : { "dst" : false, "dst_from" : null, "dst_offset" : 0, "dst_until" : null }, "raw_offset" : 32400, "timezone" : "Asia/Tokyo", "unixtime" : 1696166118, "utc_datetime" : "2023-10-01T13:15:18.742317+00:00", "utc_offset" : "+09:00", "week_number" : 39 }
----

Pretty-printed JSON example:
----
{
    "day_of_week": 0,
    "datetime": "2023-10-01T22:15:18.742317+09:00",
    "client_ip": "163.131.26.17",
    "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo",
    "unixtime": 1696166118,
    "day_of_year": 274,
    "raw_offset": 32400,
    "abbreviation": "JST",
    "dst": {
        "dst_until": null,
        "dst_offset": 0,
        "dst": false,
        "dst_from": null
    },
    "utc_datetime": "2023-10-01T13:15:18.742317+00:00",
    "utc_offset": "+09:00",
    "week_number": 39
}
----

These 2 JSON instances are semantically identical. Semantically no different at all.
Many of public URLs that respond JSON will use the Compact form.
However, when I apply the "Texts Diff" tool to JSON, I want to convert
a compact JSON into a pretty-printed JSON before taking diff.
I believe I do not need to explain why.

The following Test Case script shows how to do pretty printing.
