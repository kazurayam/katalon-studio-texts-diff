== ex32 twins diff

In some cases, we want to compare 2 environments of a single web application --- say, the Production environment and the Development. The host name of the 2 environment's URL are different, but the 2 environments have almost identical software and database but not completely the same. We are interested in the minute differences of the two. So we would do the following work procedure:

1. Download web resource from the environment P, save it into a local file
2. Download web resource from the environment D, save it into a local file
3. Pick up the 2 files, compare them to find any differences between the twins.

The following code shows the essence of the work.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex32 twins diff/Script1696149402999.groovy[]
----

This example script shows a simple function `download URL(URL, File)` that downloads any amount of bytes from a given URL and save it into a local file. This should work for any types of web resources --- HTML, JSON, XML, PDF, images, videos, etc.

This example creates output like this:

- `text1.html`
[source,html]
----
include::out/ex32/text1.html[]
----

- `text2.html`
[source,html]
----
include::out/ex32/text2.html[]
----

- `diff.md`
[source,text]
----
include::./out/ex32/diff.md[]
----

The `diff.md` file could be previewed as follows:

The result is just the same as the ex21 case.
