== ex13 diff files with absolute paths

You can specify absolute paths as the input files and the output file. Let's have a look at an example:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex13 diff files with absolute paths/Script1696121839633.groovy[]
----

The expression `System.getProperty('user.home')` will return the absolute path of "home directory" of my OS user. For example, `'/Users/kazurayam'`.

The expression `RunConfiguration.getProject()` will return a string like `/Users/kazurayam/tmp/myKatalonProject` which is the absolute path of the project's root directory.
