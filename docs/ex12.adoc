== ex12 diff 2 files with relative paths to the specified base directory

You can specify the base directory with which the relative paths are resolved. Let's have a look at an example:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex12 diff 2 files with relative paths to the specified base directory/Script1696121831700.groovy[]
----

This example calls `TextsDiffer.diffFiles(String, String, String String)` method. The 1st argument is regarded the path of a directory. When the 2nd, 3rd and 4th arguments are relative path, then these will be resolved to absolute paths taking the 1st directory path as the base.

With this method signature, you can specify input files and output file located outside the current working directory.

You can also specify an absolute path to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th argument. These absolute path will be respected regardless whatever value is given to the 1st argument.
