== ex21 diff 2 URLs

`com.kazurayam.ks.TextsDiffer.diffURLs(String,String)` method can download 2 texts from the specified URL and take diff of them. Let me show you an example.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex21 diff 2 URLs/Script1696122857223.groovy[]
----

You can have a look at the target URLs:

- link:http://myadmin.kazurayam.com/[]
- link:http://devadmin.kazurayam.com/[]

These 2 pages look similar, but is different in detail.

The script will emit the following output.

[source,text]
----
include::./out/ex21-output.md[]
----

I could preview this long Markdown text in VSCode Markdown, as follows:

image:./images/ex21.png[]

This diff tells me that the both URLs uses the same file `bootstrap-icons.css` but the versions are different. `http://myadmin.kazurayam.com` links to the version 1.5.0 while `http://devadmin.kazurayam.com` links to the version 1.7.2. Such difference is hardly visible on the page view.

Sometimes we, developers of web application, wants to compare 2 environments of a single application. For example, the Production environment and the Development. In such case, the method `TextsDiff.diffURLs()` could be useful.
