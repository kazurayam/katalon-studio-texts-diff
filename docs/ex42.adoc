== ex42 pretty print JSON while ordering Map entities by keys

The following 2 JSON instances are semantically identical.

Disordered JSON instance:
[source,json]
----
{
    "week_number": 39,
    "day_of_week": 0,
    "utc_datetime": "2023-10-01T13:15:18.742317+00:00",
    "datetime": "2023-10-01T22:15:18.742317+09:00",
    "client_ip": "163.131.26.17",
    "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo",
    "unixtime": 1696166118,
    "day_of_year": 274,
    "raw_offset": 32400,
    "dst" : {
        "dst_until": null,
        "dst_offset": 0,
        "dst_until": null,
        "dst": false,
        "dst_from": null
    },
    "utc_offset": "+09:00",
    "abbreviation": "JST"
}
----

Ordered JSON instance:
[source,json]
----
include::../app-project/build/tmp/testOutput/ex42-output.json[]
----

Please note that the `"key":"value"` pairs in the latter JSON instance
are ordered by keys alphabetically.
When I apply the "Texts Diff" tool to JSON, I want to convert a disordered JSON
into a ordered JSON before taking diff.
The following Test Case script shows how to do it.
