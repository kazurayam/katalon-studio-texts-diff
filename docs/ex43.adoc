== ex43 pretty print JSON then diff

Let me assume I have 2 JSON instances:

FileA:
[source,json]
----
{
  "key1":"data1",
  "key2":"data2"
}
----

FileB:
[source,json]
----
{
  "key2":"data2",
  "key1":"data1"
}
----

These 2 JSON instances are semantically identical.

If I apply take textual diff of the FileA and FileB, I will get the following diff report.

This diff report is arguable. This report tells me that there are textual differences. However, if I do not like to be disturbed by the differences which are semantically insignificant, the above report is too noisy.

Now I would apply the methodology "ex42 pretty print JSON while ordering Map entities by keys". I would convert the 2 input JSON and then take the diff.
The following report shows the result.

The following Test Case creates these 2 diff reports.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex43 pretty print JSON then diff/Script1696501065416.groovy[]
----

In the latter diff report, both JSON are converted by the link:https://github.com/kazurayam/katalon-studio-texts-diff/blob/develop/lib-project/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/JsonPrettyPrinter.groovy[`com.kazurayam.ks.JsonPrettyPrinter`] class to have the same order of keys. So the report clearly shows that FileA and FileB are similar.

Which diff report do you like? --- You can choose either. link:https://github.com/kazurayam/katalon-studio-texts-diff/blob/develop/lib-project/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/TextsDiffer.groovy[`com.kazurayam.ks.TestsDiffer`] and link:https://github.com/kazurayam/katalon-studio-texts-diff/blob/develop/lib-project/Keywords/com/kazurayam/ks/JsonPrettyPrinter.groovy[`com.kazurayam.ks.JsonPrettyPrinter`] are provided. You can use them and produce both report.
