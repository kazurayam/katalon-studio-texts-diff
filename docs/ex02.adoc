== ex02 diff 2 strings and write report into file

The following script does

1. The following script calls `com.kazurayam.ks.TextsDiffer.diffStrings(String, String, String)`.
2. The 1st and 2nd arguments are regarded as input text. The inputs contain XML texts which are similar but different in detail.
3. The 3rd argument is regarded as a file to write a report into.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../app-project/Scripts/ex02 diff 2 strings and write report into file/Script1707312794892.groovy[]
----

When I run it, this script emits the following JSON in the console.

```
{
    "rows": 9,
    "isDifferent": true,
    "insertedRows": 1,
    "deletedRows": 1,
    "changedRows": 2,
    "equalRows": 5
}
```

With this JSON, you can quickly see if the 2 input texts are different or not. You can parse the returned JSON string into an instance of `java.util.Map` using `groovy.json.JsonSlurper` and get access to the content. The `ex02` contains sample script how to do it.
